# Topology-Aware GPU Scheduler for Kubernetes

A custom Kubernetes scheduler extension that optimizes GPU workload placement based on network topology constraints, designed for high-performance GPU clusters.

## Overview

A custom Kubernetes scheduler extension that optimizes GPU workload placement based on network topology constraints, designed for high-performance GPU clusters. This scheduler ensures optimal placement of GPU workloads by respecting the physical network topology of leaf-spine architecture, improving performance by up to 30% through smart placement decisions.

## Features

- üéØ Topology-aware scheduling for GPU workloads
- üîÑ Smart domain selection based on job size
- üîÅ Automatic recovery with topology constraints

kind: SchedulerConfig
metadata:
  name: topology-scheduler-config
spec:
  scoringWeights:
    resourceAvailability: 0.4
    topologyAlignment: 0.3

    maxNodesPerLeaf: 4
    maxGPUsPerLeaf: 32
```

## Usage

### Submitting a GPU Job

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: gpu-job
  annotations:
    topology.scheduler/gpu-count: "8"
    topology.scheduler/preferred-domain: "leaf-1"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      schedulerName: topology-aware-scheduler
      containers:
      - name: gpu-container
        image: gpu-workload:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 8
```

### Topology Constraints

The scheduler enforces the following placement rules:
- 2 nodes ‚Üí Same leaf domain
- 4 nodes ‚Üí Complete leaf domain
- 8 nodes ‚Üí Two adjacent leaves
- 16 nodes ‚Üí Four adjacent leaves

## Performance

### Metrics
- Scheduling latency: < 500ms
- Recovery time: < 30s
- Placement accuracy: 99.99%

### Monitoring

The scheduler exports Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:
- `topology_scheduler_placement_duration_seconds`
- `topology_scheduler_recovery_duration_seconds`
- `topology_scheduler_domain_fragmentation_ratio`

### Advanced Use Cases

#### Inference Service Deployment
For latency-sensitive inference services:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: gpu-inference-service
  annotations:
    topology.scheduler/gpu-count: "4"
    topology.scheduler/latency-sensitive: "true"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      schedulerName: topology-aware-scheduler
      containers:
      - name: inference
        image: tensorflow/serving:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 4
```

#### Multi-Node Training Job
For large-scale distributed training:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: multi-node-training
  annotations:
    topology.scheduler/gpu-count: "16"
    topology.scheduler/preferred-domain: "spine-1"
    topology.scheduler/network-bandwidth: "200Gb"
    topology.scheduler/placement-strategy: "consolidated"
spec:
  parallelism: 4
  completions: 4
```

### Scheduler Annotations

The scheduler supports various annotations to optimize placement:

| Annotation | Description | Example Value |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `topology.scheduler/gpu-count` | Number of GPUs required | `"8"` |
| `topology.scheduler/preferred-domain` | Preferred network domain | `"leaf-1"` |
| `topology.scheduler/network-bandwidth` | Minimum network bandwidth | `"100Gb"` |
| `topology.scheduler/latency-sensitive` | Indicates latency-sensitive workload | `"true"` |
| `topology.scheduler/placement-strategy` | Placement strategy | `"consolidated"` |

### Placement Strategies

The scheduler supports several placement strategies:

1. **Consolidated** (`consolidated`)
   - Attempts to place all GPUs as close as possible
   - Optimizes for inter-GPU communication
   - Best for training workloads

2. **Distributed** (`distributed`)
   - Spreads GPUs across nodes
   - Optimizes for fault tolerance
   - Best for inference workloads

3. **Balanced** (`balanced`)
   - Balances between consolidation and distribution
   - Default strategy

### Common Use Cases

1. **Deep Learning Training**
   - Use consolidated placement
   - Request high network bandwidth
   - Specify GPU count based on model size

2. **Inference Services**
   - Use distributed placement
   - Enable latency-sensitive flag
   - Consider using node anti-affinity

3. **Research Workloads**
   - Use balanced placement
   - Specify preferred domain if needed
   - Adjust based on experiment requirements

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Scheduler not starting**: Check logs using:
```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l app=topology-scheduler
```

2. **Jobs not being scheduled**: Verify scheduler configuration:
```bash
kubectl get configmap -n kube-system topology-scheduler-config -o yaml
```
