# Design Document

## Overview
The Topology-Aware GPU Scheduler is a custom Kubernetes scheduler extension that optimizes GPU workload placement by considering network topology constraints.
It is designed to improve performance for GPU-intensive workloads in high-performance computing clusters by up to 30% through
intelligent placement decisions that respect physical network topology.

## Goals
- Optimize GPU workload placement based on network topology
- Minimize inter-node communication overhead for multi-GPU workloads
- Support different placement strategies for various workload types
- Provide automatic recovery while maintaining topology constraints
- Prevent cluster fragmentation
- Maintain high scheduling performance (sub-500ms latency)

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Scheduler Core**
   - Implements custom scheduling logic
   - Integrates with Kubernetes scheduler framework
   - Manages placement decisions based on topology constraints
   - Handles scheduling queue and prioritization

2. **Domain Manager**
   - Maintains network topology information
   - Tracks domain relationships (leaf-spine architecture)
   - Updates domain state in real-time
   - Handles domain capacity management

3. **Plugin Framework**
   - Filter plugins for constraint validation
   - Score plugins for placement optimization
   - Binding plugins for resource allocation
   - Extension points for custom logic

4. **Metrics Collector**
   - Gathers performance metrics
   - Monitors resource utilization
   - Tracks scheduling decisions
   - Exports Prometheus metrics

### Data Model

```go
type TopologyDomain struct {
    Name        string
    Type        DomainType  // Leaf or Spine
    Capacity    Resources
    Utilization Resources
    Nodes       []string
    Connected   []string    // Connected domains
}

type PlacementStrategy struct {
    Type           StrategyType
    WeightFactors  map[string]float64
    Constraints    []Constraint
}

type SchedulingDecision struct {
    JobID     string
    Domain    string
    NodeSet   []string
    Strategy  PlacementStrategy
    Score     float64
}
```

## Core Algorithms

### Placement Decision Flow
1. **Job Analysis**
   - Parse job requirements and annotations
   - Determine GPU count and constraints
   - Select appropriate placement strategy

2. **Domain Selection**
   - Filter eligible domains based on capacity
   - Score domains based on:
     - Resource availability (40%)
     - Topology alignment (30%)
     - Domain utilization (20%)
     - Historical performance (10%)

3. **Node Selection**
   - Filter nodes within selected domain
   - Apply anti-fragmentation rules
   - Consider hardware affinity

4. **Placement Validation**
   - Verify topology constraints
   - Check network bandwidth requirements
   - Validate domain capacity

### Recovery Mechanism
1. Detect node/domain failures
2. Identify affected workloads
3. Calculate minimal migration set
4. Execute migrations while maintaining topology constraints

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Targets
- Scheduling decisions: < 500ms
- Recovery time: < 30s
- Domain state updates: < 100ms

### Scalability
- Support for up to 1000 nodes
- Handle up to 10,000 GPU devices
- Process 100 scheduling decisions/second

### Resource Efficiency
- Memory usage: < 512MB
- CPU usage: < 1 core under normal load
- Network overhead: < 1MB/s

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics
```
